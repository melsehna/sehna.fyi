<h1>Why notes?</h1>
<time datetime="2026-01-11">January 11, 2026</time>

<p>
  Most scientific work happens long before a paper exists.
  Models are sketched, assumptions are tested, ideas are discarded,
  and partial explanations accumulate.
</p>

<p>
  These notes are a place to write down that intermediate thinking.
  They are not meant to be polished or complete, but to capture
  technical ideas as they evolve.
</p>

<p>
  Some notes may eventually turn into projects or papers.
  Others will remain fragments.
</p>

<p>
  Writing them publicly is partly a forcing function:
  to be clearer than private notes, but more flexible than formal writing.
